<p style="text-align:center">Davenport West Robotics' vision for the program began with FTC, but as interest levels for FIRST within
                             the school grew, the INSPIRE program was created. Students from these programs come together during the 3rd term of the school year
                             to create Disruptive Innovation, FRC team 6317. INSPIRE Capstone teachers are dedicated to creating a school-wide culture where
                             students identify, select, and pursue career pathways and develop necessary skills that lead to post-secondary career and/or
                             college opportunities. Students in the INSPIRE program will have the opportunity to apply for competitive internships in each pathway.
                             INSPIRE is an extension of the nationally recognized career programs at West High School.The team has continued to work
                             with its sister FTC teams, team 5466 the Combustible Lemons and team 10547 the Mortal Combots. Multiple members of
                             Disruptive Innovation are also apart of the FTC program at Davenport West.</p>

<p style="text-align:center">Over the course of three months, Disruptive Innovation
                             has nearly accomplished its goal of building and programming Farmbot with test sequences.
                             FarmBot is an open-sourced, automatic farming machine. FarmBot is capable of planting, watering,
                             weeding, and consistently monitoring a whole garden over the period of a plant's life.
                             The FarmBot was delivered in lots of parts back in December. Mr. Smith's CIM class spent a
                             month building it. Next, Disruptive innovation refined the design and began to write multiple
                             test sequences, figuring out the extent of FarmBot's capabilities. There are a total of 5 completed
                             sequences that test all of what FarmBot is capable of doing. When completed, FarmBot will be sent to
                             Buffalo Elementary School in order to teach the students there about both farming and robotics.</p>

<p style="text-align:center">When Joshua Ngao informed us about the lack of clean water
                             in his home village in Kenya, our team decided that it was a
                             problem that we wanted to devote our time to. We researched the
                             problem and came up with three different solutions, each of them
                             filtering water using a unique method. We can add value to the
                             Kenyan country by providing healthy water. We are prototyping 3
                             solutions : slow sand filtration, clay filtration, and UV disinfection.
                             We built all three prototypes, but decided on using the slow sand filter
                             because of its effectiveness, ease of replication, and the local availability
                             of the necessary materials. Using Vernier water testing equipment, we were
                             able to test water samples before and after being filtered. We sent several
                             of the water tests to Kenya with our client. Knowing more about the water
                             will help us further improve our solution, therefor reducing sickness among
                             the people of Kenya.</p>

  <h2 style="text-align: center">DAVENPORT WHS APP</h2>
  <div class="width" align ="center">
    <img src="Images/projects/whsApp.webp" alt="" style="width:50%" height="50%">
  </div>
  <p style="text-align:center">Davenport West Capstone students; Ryan, Austin, Jenna, Hannah, Clayton,
                               Dakota, Aaron, and Darian created an app for Davenport West. The purpose of the is to help students,
                               teachers, and parents fined information faster. There are six buttons that have select information on
                               each one. The six buttons are Sports, Campus, BellSched, Info, Staff, and Calendar. There is also a
                               slideshow at the bottom of the home screen that shows all the events that will be going on at west.
                               We created the app using App Inventor. App inventor uses block coding so it is not very difficult.
                               Next year students will figure out how to use android studio so that will make the app more efficient.
                               We hope that when kids see the app we made they will be encouraged to learn coding language and create
                               their own app or programs. </p>
  <h2 style="text-align: center">FALCON NEST</h2>
  <div class="width" align ="center">
    <img src="Images/projects/theNest.jpg" alt="" style="width:50%" height="50%">
  </div>
  <p style="text-align:center">In the course of 2 months, Disruptive Innovation accomplished a near-home
                               goal consisting of renovating the school pantry, known as “The Nest.” The Nest is home to numerous
                               non-perishable items for less fortunate students, giving them a guaranteed meal through rough times
                               at home. Prior to recovery, The Nest lacked appropriate storage space, loss of organization, and was
                               easily mistaken as a hoarding condition. Following the design process, DI students conducted interviews,
                               rough and final design envisions, then following with construction and proper placement. Shelving units,
                               clothes hangers, tables, and new paint were added into the room giving the blank space a new purpose.
                               Following the renovation, students in the course consistently helped stock the shelves with new meals. </p>
